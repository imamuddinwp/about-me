# Local SEO Ranking Factors

If you’re looking to improve both types of local rankings, it may be useful to see how local pack and local organic factors look when combined as an average:

1. On-page optimization \(24%\)

2. Links \(23%\)

3. GMB \(20%\)

4. Reviews \(11%\)

5. Behavioral \(9%\)

6.= Citations \(7%\)

6.= Personalization \(7%\)

When planning your local SEO strategy, always bear in mind that different factors will require very different time investments, so it’s not as simple as reading these results and saying, “Okay, I’ll spend X% of my time on X”.

Link building, for example, is a time-intensive and ongoing task, whereas a lot of work with reviews or citations can be automated or outsourced, freeing you up to focus on other factors.
