# Local SEO \| What & Why Local SEO

[Local SEO](https://imamuddinwp.gitbook.io/local-seo/) \(Local Search Engine Optimization\), which is a strategy that helps your business be more visible in local search results on Google. It is an incredibly effective way to **market** your **local** business online, as it helps businesses promote their products and services to **local** customers at the exact time they're looking for them online.

 [**Local SEO**](https://imamuddin.business.site/) also encompasses factors that don't play a major role in traditional **SEO**, such as Google My **Business**, **local** directories, and proximity to the searcher. A **business** that invests in **local SEO** is more likely to attract customers to their website as well as to their [**business location**](https://github.com/imamuddinwp).
